# Analyzing the financial records

I have been tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. They wanted to see;

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
